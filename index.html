        <h2>A little About me...</h2>
        <p>
          " Ever since I first attended a Tech-fest and saw the ever-growing
          horizons of innovation, I have been hooked to the field of Engineering
          and Tech. Now after pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science, Masters
          in Information Systems, and working on some innovative products I am
          on the lookout to keep fueling this passion.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey into tech began with a deep curiosity about how small
          pieces of innovation can have a significant impact on people's lives.
          This curiosity led me to explore various domains within the tech
          world. I started as a Software Developer at Lazertech Solutions, then
          delved into Data Engineering & Analysis at Kpranali Investments, and
          contributed as a Web Developer at Softcell Technologies to help them
          establish a digital presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my Masterâ€™s program, I expanded my skill set further by working
          with Founderway as a Developer and later as a Tech Lead. I also gained
          valuable experience as a Technical Intern and currently as a Software
          Developer at Bummock AI. These roles have broadened my expertise and
          deepened my understanding of the tech landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of these experiences made me realize that I have a passion for
          tech that helps me learn a lot in all domains I pursue. I tend to gain
          expertise in the domain I work in and am great with juggling between
          tasks and managing my time to do justice to the work I do. It is my
          diverse interests and team spirit that help me make the most out of
          every opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I am an avid reader and have a great appreciation for
          creativity and art forms. I take pleasure from simple things like
          walking, listening to music, and most of all cooking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am really excited about tech and innovation and eager to connect
          with like-minded professionals to learn from them and make a positive
          impact together. "
